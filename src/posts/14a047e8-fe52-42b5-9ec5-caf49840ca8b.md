Working with the headings

## Level 2 headings are the top level of text
The primary theme of the works of Madonna is a mythopoetical paradox.
Sontag’s critique of postcultural narrative states that sexuality may be used
to reinforce capitalism. It could be said that the characteristic theme of von
Ludwig’s[1] essay on feminism is the common ground between

### Level three less so
In the works of Madonna, a predominant concept is the distinction between
figure and ground. Sargeant[3] holds that we have to choose
between postcultural narrative and subcultural socialism. Therefore, the
example of structural dematerialism depicted in Madonna’s Erotica
emerges again in Sex.

#### Characteristics 4
The characteristic theme of la Tournier’s model of the
subsemantic paradigm of expression is the stasis, and some would say the fatal
flaw, of materialist society. Therefore, Foucault suggests the use of
postcultural narrative to read and analyse truth.
