Where do you see yourself in five years they always asked

When Linda at Joyent asked me that I said something like Five years ago I didn’t imagine myself looking for a job again. And five years after that, here I am again. 

So what was I doing all that figurewhen I was supposed to be laying down the groundwork for rising to be senior vice president of product strategy?

I spent some time trying to figure out my relationship to the world and whether that included god or not

I had a child who turned out to be spectrumy. A child makes you humble. A school district makes you strong.
