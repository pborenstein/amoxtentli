It's just fucking weird.

I'm sitting right here, and I can't do anything but fiddle around with the spotify settings, trying to find the perfect zoom level -- which you can't do because you can't controll the column widths, let alone column order 

And the thing you need to do
and the thing I need to do
is right there in the screen above this one
I just can't
and I can't explain it other than
it will be terrible if I start
I will start and realize that it's hopeless
so as long as I don't start there
is still hope
I'm a smart guy -- that sales guy who was my last manager said that to me. I took it to be the way you call a white guy 'articulate' --
I mean
there's is a big range between hopeless and doable.
And I know this
but I need to do this one more thing
I need to smoke one more 
I need to find something to eat
and then then then then
I'll be ready
it's all about being ready
being prepared
preparing to be ready
and I'm not quite ready to be ready to prepare to be ready

oh god I cannot make it stop
it's so ridiculously easy
I must be making it up
I mean look I have time to write this
in the time I was writing this I could have been done
or at least have the knowledge of whether it was a disaster
or whether there is still hope.

There will come a point
I know there will
and I hope it's sooner
when I'll just
DO IT
but it's that point
I have to get ready to get to that point
where I can jump
this feels just like jumping off the hi board at sabra
It took me most of the two weeks four weeks
to do it
and when I finally did it
it was kind of anticlimatic
and the parachute ride at six flags
I was dropped about 20 times
I could never do it again
but man did I feel in control
I was with no one by myself
and THIS is what I was doing
and I didn't need anyone else to do it with
