summary: "But that will be a long time from now, and soon now we shall  go out of the house and go into the convulsion of the world."
---


_Robert Penn Warren_

We shall come back, no doubt, to walk down the Row and watch young people on the tennis courts by the clump of mimosas and walk down the beach by the bay, where the diving floats lift gently in the sun, and on out to the pine grove, where the needles thick on the ground will deaden the footfall so that we shall move among the trees as soundlessly as smoke. But that will be a long time from now, and soon now we shall  go out of the house and go into the convulsion of the world, out of history into history and the awful responsibility of Time.
